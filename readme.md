# Alchitry Cu Experiments
This repository contains my personal experiments with the Alchitry Cu FPGA board. It's mostly just me messing around, but may occasionally contain my solutions to textbook problems. 

The only thing I expect may be useful to others here is the work I've done in the cu.pcf file. I've expanded on the mapping for the Alchitry Io board, since I use that pretty regularly. 

This repo was inspired by and forked from https://github.com/codysnider/alchitry-cu-tutorial
